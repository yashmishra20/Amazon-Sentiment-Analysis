        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to analyze and classify sentiments from Amazon reviews. The data used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and involves text reviews of products from Amazon. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the sentiment of these reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:\n",
        "   - Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.\n",
        "   - Clean and preprocess the text data to prepare it for modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model Development**:\n",
        "   - Implement traditional machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes) to classify sentiments.\n",
        "   - Develop and evaluate various neural network models (e.g., RNN, LSTM, Bi-RNN, Bi-LSTM) for sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Evaluation**:\n",
        "   - Compare the performance of different models using accuracy and other metrics.\n",
        "   - Identify the best-performing model and evaluate its performance with detailed metrics and visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Description\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset consists of Amazon product reviews with the following columns:\n",
        "- **`label`**: The sentiment label (positive or negative).\n",
